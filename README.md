# Movie-and-Book-Recommendation-System
## Movie Recommendation System
It is a content-based movie recommendation system that uses cosine similarity. <br>
In this, I use [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), which is an open-source app framework in Python language, which turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes. <br>

## Book Recommendation System
It is a collaborative-filtering-based book recommendation system. <br>
